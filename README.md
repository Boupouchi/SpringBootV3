# SpringBootV3
The School Management System is a comprehensive application built on a robust tech stack, including Spring Boot, Maven, Hibernate, JPA, and an SQL database. It enables efficient management of students, roles, and filieres using standard CRUD operations. The system is built on the Spring Boot framework, providing a streamlined development environment for enterprise-grade applications. Maven is used for project management and dependency resolution, while Hibernate and JPA are powerful ORM technologies for seamless data interaction and database management. The system relies on an SQL database for secure data storage and management.

The core functionality of the system includes student management, role management, and filiere management. Users can easily create, view, update, and delete student records, while Filiere management organizes and categorizes students based on their academic pursuits. The system is also integrated with Swagger, a powerful tool for documenting, testing, and interacting with the API.

The School Management System is a versatile solution for educational institutions seeking a reliable and efficient platform for managing student information, roles, and academic programs. The use of well-established technologies and Swagger integration for API interaction makes it a valuable asset in education management.
